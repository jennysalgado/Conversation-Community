# conversation-lite

Slightly modified version of the conversation-simple Watson Conversation UI that can be hosted directly from a GitHub repository.

Before chatting, just provide your workspace ID, username and password, which can be found on the Credentials page of the Conversation tooling.

Currently requires conversation-proxy because the Watson Conversation API does not support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
