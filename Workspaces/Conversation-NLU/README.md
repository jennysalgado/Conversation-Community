# Cognitive Car Dashboard Application powered by Conversation and NLU

This application demonstrates how to integrate Natural Language Understanding (NLU) service with Watson Conversation service to extract generic entities and pass those to the Conversation service. This application is an extension of the Conversation Simple application where it adds integration to another Watson service, namely NLU as well as a third party API, namely Weather Underground API.
